This is a small library for solving the poisson equation
[[https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\nabla^2&space;\phi&space;=&space;-f][\nabla^2 \phi = -f]]
on unit unbounded and periodic domains.

* Installing prerequisites
  To install prerequisites for running the script, do
  #+begin_src sh
	pip install -r requirements.txt
  #+end_src
  This installs the ~numpy,scipy~ and ~matplotlib~ scientific stack on your
  system.

* Usage
To make the poisson solver, use
#+begin_src python
  from poisson_solver import make_poisson_solver, PoissonOrder
  solver = make_poisson_solver(
	  grid_size, # number of points preferably 2**n
	  dx, # grid spacing
	  x_boundary_condition="unbounded", # x direction boundary condition
	  y_boundary_condition="periodic", # y direction boundary condition
	  order_of_accuracy=PoissonOrder(4) # order of accuracy needed
  )
#+end_src
where
- ~x_boundary_condition~ is one of ~unbounded~ or ~periodic~
- ~y_boundary_condition~ is one of ~unbounded~ or ~periodic~
- ~order_of_accuracy~ is one of ~0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10~. ~0~ does not mean
  zero-order accuracy, but represents the /unregularized/ version and is always
  second order accurate.

~order_of_accuracy~ does not matter for purely periodic domains : the solver is
spectrally accurate in this case (accuracy till machine precision if function
can be properly resolved)
